## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.
2. **Docker:** Install the Docker desktop app to run the MongoDB service.
3. **Pipenv:** Install Pipenv for managing dependencies:
    ```bash
        pip install pipenv
    ```
3. **Environment Variables:** Prepare a .env file for both the ML client and web app.

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/4-containers-put-the-fries-in-the-bag.git
```
### **Change Directory**
```bash
    cd 4-containers-put-the-fries-in-the-bag
```

### **Set Up Environment Variables**
- Create a .env file in the root directory of the repository.
- Please check Discord for more information about the .env file.

### **Set Up the Machine Learning Client**
- Navigate to the ml-client directory:
    ```bash
        cd machine_learning_client
    ```
- Activate the Pipenv virtual environment:
    ```bash
        pipenv shell
    ```
- Install development dependencies:
    ```bash
        pipenv install --dev
    ```

### **Set Up the Web App Client**
- Navigate to the ml-client directory:
